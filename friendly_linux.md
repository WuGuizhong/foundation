# Friendly Linux
---
This file is created as I want to maintain a friendly linux.

Version: Ubuntu-kylin 15.4

The function of Linux is listed as below:

-- Daily work

-- Web broswer

-- Dicts

-- Media

-- Github

-- C++ programming

-- and more...


## Web Browser

Firefox is more convenient.

Chromium is used to break through the wall.
